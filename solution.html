To resolve this issue, verify the following:

1. **Plugin Installation:** Ensure that the Tailwind CSS plugin for gradients is correctly installed and configured in your `tailwind.config.js` file.  If using a custom configuration, double-check that gradient-related settings are correctly specified.

2. **Configuration Check:** Review your `tailwind.config.js` file to ensure that the necessary gradient configuration is added:

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      // Add custom gradient configurations here if needed
    },
  },
  plugins: [
    // ... other plugins
    require('@tailwindcss/forms'),
    require('@tailwindcss/typography')
  ],
}
```

3. **CSS Conflicts:** Examine your CSS for any potential conflicts that might override the Tailwind gradient styles. Ensure that your Tailwind CSS directives are applied correctly and not superseded by other stylesheets.

4. **Correct Usage:** Check that you are using the correct gradient syntax. It's crucial that the classes `from-`, `to-`, and `via-` (if used) are followed by valid Tailwind color values.

5. **Purge Unused Styles:** Run `npm run build` to ensure the Tailwind CSS purge step removes unused CSS to help prevent conflicts.

By addressing these points, the gradient should correctly render.  The solution file demonstrates the corrected code with error handling and improved clarity.
