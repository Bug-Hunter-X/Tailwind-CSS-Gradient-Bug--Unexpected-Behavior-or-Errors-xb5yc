The following Tailwind CSS code results in an unexpected error:```

<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <p>This is some text.</p>
</div>
```

This code intends to create a gradient background that transitions from blue to purple. However, depending on the configuration and other factors, it may not produce the desired effect and may throw errors related to unknown utility classes or missing plugins.
